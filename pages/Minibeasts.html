            Butterflies

            Butterflies are the adult flying stage of certain insects belonging
            to an order or group called Lepidoptera. Moths also belong to this
            group. This name perfectly suits the insects in this group because
            their wings are covered with thousands of tiny scales overlapping in
            rows. The scales, which are arranged in colorful designs unique to
            each species, are what gives the butterfly its beauty. Like all
            other insects, butterflies have six legs and three main body parts:
            head, thorax (chest or mid section) and abdomen (tail end). They
            also have two antennae and an exoskeleton. Butterflies are insects
            in the macrolepidopteran clade Rhopalocera from the order
            Lepidoptera, which also includes moths.

            Spiders are air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs,
            chelicerae with fangs generally able to inject venom, and spinnerets
            that extrude silk. Spiders are found worldwide on every continent
            except for Antarctica.
